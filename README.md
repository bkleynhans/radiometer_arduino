# Field Radiometer

Design, develop and build a network of low-cost radiometers.  The project attempts to provide a cost-effective means for collecting data pertaining to surface temperatures.  The data will be used for the verification of surface temperature products within space borne systems.  The unit consists of 5 boards that are programmed to: collect data, save the data and upload the data to a remote server for analysis every 24 hours.

This project is still in progress.
